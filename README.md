# weather-app

I've implemented this layout design to make it look pleasing in the eye. And because it is responsive it is better to have minimal design to allow the user focus in getting the information they need either through mobile or desktop. The application provides info for the user to determine what would be the status of the weather in the specificed places in Japan which are: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, and Nagoya.

This application also includes nearby places for whatever the user has searched.

> You can clone/download, open the index file and search specified places in Japan.
